# Monarq Technology – How It Works

## 🔒 Escrow Engine Process
1. A transaction is created and assets are locked in escrow  
2. Predefined conditions are coded (e.g., “Deliver X, then release Y”)  
3. Once conditions are met, escrow automatically executes  
4. If conditions fail, funds are safely returned
